I have chosen to work with a data file from the DAT 220 Final Project. This data was observing customers of a specific store with both a physical and online presence. For this artifact, I would like to create a MongoDB interface that allows a user to quickly search for data within the file. Some of the queries I would like to implement are for simple searches within each field, as well as the ability to query for customer data by state, city, age group, etc.
