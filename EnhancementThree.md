For the Database part of the project, I have chosen to work with a data file from the DAT 220 Final Project. This data was observing customers of a specific store with both a physical and online presence. For this artifact, I would like to create a MongoDB interface that allows a user to quickly search for data within the file. Some of the queries I would like to implement are for simple searches within each field, as well as the ability to query for customer data by state, city, age group, etc.
I chose to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because it allowed me to not only to learn how to build a data base but manipulate it as well. These skills are great to have when working on projects dealing with MongoDB and other associated platforms.
While working on the enhancement, I believe that I did meet the course objective because I made the necessary updates to better understand what is happening with the program and made it slightly more user friendly when the user is looking for data.  
Just like the other enhancements I’ve been working on for this project, it’s been nice to go back and look over the work I’ve done and be able to make changes using the skills I’ve learned alone the way. I know the enhancements could be better and more could probably be done but just knowing that I am able to make the updates I have is pretty good to me.
