Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

For this category of the project I would like to revisit CS 360, where I spent a lot night trying to figure out how to create a “inventory” application that could help users better track, order and manage products in their stores. I was able to get a working application submitted for my final project in the class but I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the app, so I would like to go back and revamp the application. 
My enhancement plan will be to take the code I have and continue to build on it by changing the layout, adding a “username” and “password” for security, then moving on to the application itself I will create some code that will allow the user to search for items in their inventory, show the cost, and provide the quantity to the user so they could order what they need. 
I wanted this artifact in my ePortfolio, because I spent a lot of time and hard work on this project. I feel like I did a little bit of everything while working on this project such as math, coding and just having a creative mindset to get the inventory application off and running. The application was improved by adding a login screen that had the user input their username/email address whichever they wanted and a password. Another improvement was that the user could add more items to the total population list at the bottom of the screen instead of just one item.
While enhancing the mobile application, I was able to think more clearly since I already put in a good amount of effort to get the application working. I was also able to play with the application itself to make sure that it fit the needs of the user.
