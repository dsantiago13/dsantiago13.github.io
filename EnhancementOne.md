Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

For this category of the project I would like to revisit CS 360, where I spent a lot night trying to figure out how to create a “inventory” application that could help users better track, order and manage products in their stores. I was able to get a working application submitted for my final project in the class but I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the app, so I would like to go back and revamp the application. 
My enhancement plan will be to take the code I have and continue to build on it by changing the layout, adding a “username” and “password” for security, then moving on to the application itself I will create some code that will allow the user to search for items in their inventory, show the cost, and provide the quantity to the user so they could order what they need.
