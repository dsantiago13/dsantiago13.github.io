I.	Category One: Software Engineering/Design (CS 360: Mobile Architect and Programming)

For this category of the project I would like to revisit CS 360, where I spent a lot night trying to figure out how to create a “inventory” application that could help users better track, order and manage products in their stores. I was able to get a working application submitted for my final project in the class but I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the app, so I would like to go back and revamp the application. 
My enhancement plan will be to take the code I have and continue to build on it by changing the layout, adding a “username” and “password” for security, then moving on to the application itself I will create some code that will allow the user to search for items in their inventory, show the cost, and provide the quantity to the user so they could order what they need. 

II.	Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures (CS 260 Data Structures and Algorithms)

For this part of the project I have decided to go with CS 260 where I learned about Data Structures and Algorithms. During this class I was tasked with providing eBid Nashville in the final project with the proper analysis to give them the best information using C++. The goal was to use binary trees because it is the quickest of the data structures. I plan to go through the project and find ways to use algorithms and data structures to make it more efficient and complex. This will demonstrate my skills with algorithms and data structures. 

III.	Category Three: Databases (DAT 220 Fundamentals of Data Mining)

This category, I have chosen to work with a data file from the DAT 220 Final Project. This data was observing customers of a specific store with both a physical and online presence. For this artifact, I would like to create a MongoDB interface that allows a user to quickly search for data within the file. Some of the queries I would like to implement are for simple searches within each field, as well as the ability to query for customer data by state, city, age group, etc.
