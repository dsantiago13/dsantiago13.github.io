I have decided to go with CS 260 where I learned about Data Structures and Algorithms. During this class I was tasked with providing eBid Nashville in the final project with the proper analysis to give them the best information using C++. The goal was to use binary trees because it is the quickest of the data structures. I plan to go through the project and find ways to use algorithms and data structures to make it more efficient and complex. This will demonstrate my skills with algorithms and data structures.
